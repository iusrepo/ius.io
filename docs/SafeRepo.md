# The SafeRepo Initiative

Many third party repositories exist for Enterprise Linux distributions.  These
repositories provide several different types of packages.  Not all repositories
clearly describe the types of packages that are provided, which may lead to
unexpected results.  The SafeRepo Initiative is a set of guidelines for third
party repositories to follow in order to help users avoid these unexpected
results.

## Terminology

* **stock distribution**:  A Linux distribution as it comes from the vendor.
  Examples include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora.
* **stock package**: A package that a stock distribution provides by default in
  their enabled repositories.
* **third party repository**:  A package repository intended for use with a
  Linux distribution that is not associated with the vendor of the
  distribution.
* **third party package**: A package that a third party repository provides.

## Current Problem With Third Party Repositories

When you subscribe to third party repositories, you often don't know what will
happen.  Different third party repositories behave differently.  Some
repositories only provide additional packages that are not in the stock
distribution.  Other repositories contain newer versions of stock packages with
the same name.  Many do not fully describe the types of packages they provide,
which can lead to unexpected results for end users.

**When a repository doesn't clearly describe the types of packages they
provide, users of the repositories are put at risk.**

Here is a common example.  A user subscribes to a third party repository for a
newer major version of MySQL.  Later, they discover that their application is
broken because PHP was also updated to a new major version during updates.

### Examples of Safe Repositories

* [EPEL][0]: Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux is a Fedora Special Interest
  Group that provides high quality additional packages for Enterprise Linux.
  They have strict guidelines that their packages should never [conflict][2]
  with or replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distribution.
  Therefore, subscribing to EPEL is safe in that nothing will happen unless you
  explicitly install a package from the repo.

* [IUS][1]: The IUS Project provides packages for Enterprise Linux that
  follow the latest upstream stable versions of specific software.  IUS is a
  safe repository because it uses alternate package names that [provide][3] the
  corresponding stock package name, but do not [obsolete][4] the stock package.
  IUS packages also explicitly [conflict][2] with their stock counterparts to
  further prevent anything from IUS automatically replacing a stock package.

### Examples of Unsafe Repositories

We are not going to explicitly call out specific projects, but there are ways
to recognize unsafe repositories.

* Packages that [obsolete][2] stock packages.
* Packages that use the same name as stock packages, which effectively
  obsoletes the stock package.

## Safe Package Types

### Add-on Package

* A package that provides software that does not exist in the stock
  distribution.
* Must not have the same name as any stock distribution package.
* Must not [obsolete][4] any stock distribution package.
* Must not [conflict][2] with any stock distribution package.
* If later added to the stock distribution, it must be removed from the third
  party repository.

### Parallel Installable Package

* A package that provides an alternate version of a stock distribution package.
* Uses a different name than the stock distribution package so it can be
  installed at the same time as the stock distribution package.
* Files from the package must use different names than files from stock
  distribution packages to avoid file conflicts.
* Must not [provide][3] the stock distribution package name.
* Must not [obsolete][4] any stock distribution package.
* Must not [conflict][2] with any stock distribution package.

### Safe Replacement Package

* A package that provides an alternate version of a stock distribution package.
* Uses a different name than the stock distribution package to prevent
  unintended upgrades.
* [Provide][3] the stock distribution package name to satisfy the dependencies
  of other packages.
* Be compatible with other stock distribution packages that depend on the stock
  distribution package being replaced.
* [Conflict][2] with the stock distribution package that is being replaced.
* Replaces the functionality of the stock distribution package that is being
  replaced.
* Must not [obsolete][4] the stock distribution package that is being replaced.

## Unsafe Package Types

### Direct Replacement Package

* A package that provides an alternate version of a stock distribution package.
* Uses the same name as the stock distribution package to allow for direct
  upgrades.
* Replaces the functionality of the stock distribution package that is being
  replaced.
* If a repository provides this type of package, it is recommended that the
  repositories be disabled by default to avoid unintended upgrades.
