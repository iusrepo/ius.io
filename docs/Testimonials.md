## User Testimonials

Jason Garber - Senior Systems Engineer, AppCove, Inc.

> Imagine being able to combine the rock-solid stability of RedHat Enterprise
> Linux (or Oracle, Centos, Scientific) with the latest versions of popular
> software packages like PHP, Python, MySQL, mod_wsgi, redis, and others?
>
> The IUS Community Project is the answer.
>
> Enterprise Linux is great for the stability, security, and compatibility. But
> sometimes you need a newer version of an installed package, like Python. At the
> time of this writing, RedHat is still not providing any standard way to obtain
> Python 3.2, MySQL 5.5, or PHP 5.4, years after they have been released.
>
> The IUS Community project has provided AppCove, Inc. and all of our clients the
> perfect mix of stability and functionality. IUS has enabled us to focus on our
> core competencies (software development) while being confident that the
> packages we use are as secure and up-to-date as possible.
>
> Our confidence in the IUS team is second to none. AppCove has worked in close
> conjunction with the IUS team on several occasions, and they have always been
> impeccably experienced, knowledgeable, and professional.
>
> We highly recommend that any users of RedHat Enterprise Linux, Oracle
> Enterprise Linux, Scientific Linux, or Centos Linux take a close look at the
> IUS Community Project for their servers.

Matt Juszczak - Founder, Bitlancer LLC

> Many of our customers hesitate to use RHEL/CentOS because of the lack of recent
> software versions. I remember that late night when we found the IUS repository
> and were able to avoid an all-nighter. Not only are the packages in-line with
> upstream, but they’re centralized, clean, consistent, well-tested, trustworthy,
> and opt-in.
>
> Just last week, we migrated a large customer from custom-compiled packages to
> IUS Community, and they’re now avoiding dependency headaches and enjoying
> up-to-date packages like the rest of us.

Scott Arkin - Founder, eHungry, Inc.

> The IUS Community Project has enabled our engineering team to complete a very
> in-depth infrastructure transition from various operating systems and
> custom-built software over to a clean, organized, and predictable
> infrastructure at Rackspace – all without spending a single minute on building,
> testing or maintaining custom software packages. Furthermore, we have the
> confidence that our software stack will continue to stay current with the
> latest security and maintenance updates.


Nicole Rodgers - Vice President of Operations, Technology Marketing Toolkit, Inc.

> Being able to have our developers spend their time on application development
> instead of building and installing software has made a significant difference
> for us. Using acn-linux and the IUS Community Project, our system
> administrators average less than 30 minutes to go from a freshly created cloud
> server to a fully secure and functional hosting environment. Because of our
> heavy use of the IUS Community Project, we are able to redirect approximately
> $5,000 per year from system administration over to application development.
