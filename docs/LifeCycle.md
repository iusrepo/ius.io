# Life Cycle

## Distibution Life Cycle

IUS only builds packages for [current versions][current] of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux and CentOS.  This does not include [extended life cycle
options][extended] from Red Hat.  New package requests will no longer be
accepted once Production 3 Phase starts.

## Package Life Cycle

RHEL has a [10 year life cycle][1], during which time stock packages recieve
[backported][2] security fixes.  These packages usually stay locked to a
particular upstream version, regardless of whether that version is still
supported by the upstream project.

On the other hand, IUS packages follow their respective upstream version.  This
is usually isoloated to a supported upstream branch (usually the major.minor
version).  This makes it unnecessary to backport security fixes, since the
latest upstream version typically contains fixes for all known vulnerabilities.
Once the upstream project declares a version end of life (EOL), IUS moves the
relevant packages from our stable repositories to our archive repositories.

It is important to note that IUS packages will not automatically upgrade to the
next major version.  Upgrading from foobar25u to foobar26u is a manual process,
similar to upgrading from stock foobar.  Even when foobar 2.5 is declared EOL
upstream, no automatic upgrade to foobar26u will take place.

## Upstream Policies and EOL Dates
