# IUS Community Project

> _**I**nline with **U**pstream **S**table_

IUS is a community project that provides RPM packages for newer versions of
select software for Enterprise Linux distributions.

## Project Goals

* Create high quality RPM packages for Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) and
  CentOS.
* Promptly release updated RPM packages once new versions are released by the
  upstream developers.
* No automatic replacement of stock RPM packages.

## Available Packages

We typically package the latest stable versions of PHP, Python, MySQL, and
more.  A complete list can be found [here][1].

## Contact Us

Most of our development is done in [GitHub][2], so that is the best way to
reach us.  Our package sources can be found in the [iuscommunity-pkg][3]
organization; issues for specific packages should be reported here.  We also
have the [iuscommunity][4] organization for everything else, such as [the
source for this website][5] and our [new package wishlist][6].

Other contact methods:

* `#iuscommunity` on [freenode][7]
* [general mailing list][8]
* [development mailing list][9]
