# IUS Community Project

> **I**nline with **U**pstream **S**table

IUS is a community project that provides RPM packages for newer versions of
select software for Enterprise Linux distributions.

## Project Goals

* Create high quality RPM packages for Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® (RHEL) and
  CentOS.
* Promptly release updated RPM packages once new versions are released by the
  upstream developers.
* No automatic replacement of stock RPM packages.

## How To Use

After becoming familiar with our [philosophies][1], install the appropriate
[release RPM][2] to enable our repository.  There are several valid methods for
installing IUS packages; please refer to our [usage][3] guide for specifics.

## Contact Us

Most of our development is done in [GitHub][4], so that is the best way to
reach us.  Our package sources can be found in the [iuscommunity-pkg][5]
organization; issues for specific packages should be reported here.  We also
have the [iuscommunity][6] organization for everything else, such as [the
source for this website][7], [announcement notifications][8], and our [new
package wishlist][9].  We can also be found in `#iuscommunity` on
[freenode][10].
